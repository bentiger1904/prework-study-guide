       <li>It's important to frequently sync the local version of your code with the remote version in GitHub</li>
       <li>Make sure you're in the correct branch on command line: git add -A: to stage changes</li>
       <li>git commit -m "add commit message here": Commit messages should be short descriptive messages of the changes implemented</li>
       <li>git pull origin main: makes sure that our current branch is up to date before opening a pull request</li>
       <li>git push origin branchname: pushes up the changes</li>
       <li>On github navigate to the branch and select pull requests tab. Click new pull request button</li>
       <li>Base branch should be main and compare branch should be branch I want to merge. Click create pull request</li>
       <li>Add title and description, in real-world assign others to review code before merging. once ready click create pull request</li>
       <li>Click merge pull request and confirm</li>
       <li>Open up terminal and update our local repository: git checkout main: first then: git pull origin main</li>
       <li>The close associated issue on github</li>
       <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
    <li>git checkout main: switches me to main branch</li>
    <li>git status: confirms the branch I'm on</li>
    <li>git pull origin main: ensures local and remote branches are in sync</li>
    <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
    <li>Navigate to folder: cd folder-name: create new file in folder: touch new-file-name-same-as-new-branch</li>

          <li>Create a new branch for a javascript file, navigate to correct folder and create .js file</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code using var keyword</li>
          <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon</li>
          <li>Link to HTML within body element below the footer with: script src="path-to-javascript-file.js" /script</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of adding decision-making into our code. code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of, normally related, data.</li>
          <li>arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1.</li>
          <li>A For loop performs a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0</li>
          <li>The 2nd statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the array length, the loop will keep running.</li>
          <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. x++ is shortcut for x+1</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses ()</li>
          <li>The code to be executed is written inside the curly brackets {}</li>
          <li>Chrome DevTools console can be used to quickly test JavaScript code.</li>
          <li>Declaring a function does not mean it will automatically execute. We need to call the function in the code at the spot we want it to execute.</li>
